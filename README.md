This project is designed to provide a comprehensive system for managing and analyzing drug data for two factories, W1 and SLY. The system consists of a frontend built with Vue 3, TypeScript, ECharts, and Element UI, and a backend powered by Node.js and Express, with MySQL as the database. The application includes three main web pages: a login page, a management page, and a dashboard page.
